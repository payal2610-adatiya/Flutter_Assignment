Module 9: Animations and Transitions

Que 1:Explain the difference between implicit and explicit animations in Flutter.

Ans:Implicit Animations (Easy):
Built-in widgets that animate automatically
Just change the values, animation happens by itself
Examples: AnimatedContainer, AnimatedOpacity
Like: Automatic car - just press gas/brake

Explicit Animations (Manual):
You control every part of the animation
More flexible but more code
Use AnimationController, Tween, etc.
Like: Manual car - you control gear, clutch, everything.

Que 2:Describe the purpose of AnimationController and its usage.
Ans: The "remote control" for your animations
Purpose:
Starts, stops, and controls animation speed
Manages animation duration (how long it runs)
Provides current animation value (0.0 to 1.0)

Que 3: Explain the concept of Hero animations in Flutter.
Ans:  Smooth transition when moving a widget between screens
How it works:
Tag widgets with same "hero tag" on both screens
Flutter automatically animates between them
Creates flying/morphing effect
