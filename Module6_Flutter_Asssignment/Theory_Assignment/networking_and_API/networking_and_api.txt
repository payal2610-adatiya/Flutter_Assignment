Module 7: Networking and API Integration

Que 1:  Explain what a RESTful API is and its importance in mobile applications.

Ans: A RESTful API is an interface that follows REST architecture principles, using HTTP requests to communicate between mobile apps and servers. It's important because it enables mobile apps to:
-Retrieve and sync data from web servers
-Work with cloud databases
-Integrate with third-party services
-Maintain separation between client and server

Que 2:Describe how JSON details parsed and used in Flutter.
Ans: JSON data in Flutter is parsed using:
-dart: convert package for basic parsing
-Manual parsing with json.decode() and json.encode()
-Automated parsing with json_serializable or built_value
-Converted into Dart objects using factory constructors

Que 3: Explain the purpose of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and when to use each.
GET: Retrieve data from server (read-only)
POST: Create new resources on server
PUT: Update existing resources (full update)
DELETE: Remove resources from server
Example usage:
GET /users - fetch all users
POST /users - create new user
PUT /users/1 - update user with ID 1
DELETE /users/1 - delete user with ID 1
