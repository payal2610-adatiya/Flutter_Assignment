Que 1: Explain the difference between local storage options (shared_preferences, SQLite, Hive):

Ans: Difference between local storage options:
shared_preferences → Stores small key-value pairs (like settings, login status). Not for complex data.
SQLite → Relational database for structured data with tables, rows, queries. Good for complex, relational storage.
Hive → NoSQL database, very fast, stores objects directly, works offline, great for Flutter apps.


Que 2: Describe CRUDoperations and how they are implemented in SQLite or Hive.

Ans:CRUD operations in SQLite / Hive:
C (Create) → Insert data into table/box.
R (Read) → Fetch/query data from table/box.
U (Update) → Modify existing records.
D (Delete) → Remove records.
->In SQLite → done using SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).
->In Hive → done using box methods (put, get, putAt, delete).

Que 3: Explain the advantages and use cases for shared_preferences.

Ans: Advantages & use cases of shared_preferences:
Advantages → Simple API, lightweight, persistent across app restarts.
Use cases → Storing login state, theme mode, user settings, small flags, and preferences.
